# fresh project

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### TODO later

- better filter UI... list of blogs... solo / mute
- channels / tags for some grouping
- copy / paste, modify template, custom designs

- stats about fetch time... who's the slow feed?
- also fetch errors can be displayed
